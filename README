NAME
      Sys::Hostname::FQDN - Get the short or long hostname

SYNOPSIS
      use Sys::Hostname::FQDN qw(
            asciihostinfo
            gethostinfo
            inet_ntoa
            inet_aton
            fqdn
            short
      );

      $host = short();
      $fqdn = fqdn();
      ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs)=gethostinfo();
      ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs)=asciihostinfo();
      $dotquad = inet_ntoa($netaddr);
      $netaddr = inet_aton($dotquad);

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

    Solaris users, see the 'hints' subdirectory if you have problems with
    the build.

DESCRIPTION
    Sys::Hostname::FQDN uses the host 'C' library to discover the (usually)
    short host name, then uses (perl) gethostbyname to extract the real
    hostname.

    The results from gethostbyname are exported as gethostinfo and
    asciihostinfo as a convenience since they are available. Similarly, the
    'C' library functions inet_ntoa and inet_aton are exported.

    $host = short();
          returns the host part of this host's FQDN.

    $fqdn = fqdn();
          returns the fully qualified host name of this host.

    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs)=gethostinfo();
          returns:
            $name       fully qualifed host name of this host.
            $aliases    alternate names for this host.
            $addrtype   The type of address; always AF_INET at present.
            $length     The length of the address in bytes.
            @addrs      array of network addresses for this host 
                        in network byte order.

    ($name,$aliases,$addrtype,$length,@addrs)=asciihostinfo();
          returns:
            $name       fully qualifed host name of this host.
            $aliases    alternate names for this host.
            $addrtype   The type of address; always AF_INET at present.
            $length     The length of the address in bytes.
            @addrs      array of dot quad IP addresses for this host.

    $dotquad = inet_ntoa($netaddr);
          input:        packed network address in network byte order.
          returns:      dot quad IP address.

    $netaddr = inet_aton($dotquad);
          input:        dot quad IP address.
          returns:      packed network address in network byte order.
